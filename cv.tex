\newcommand{\professionalstatement}{
I am an intellectually adventurous student of life, with a passion for doing things \emph{right}. Broadly, my interests lie along the intersections of quantitative and computational Earth science and ecology, Wilderness conservation and field work, and leadership, mentorship, and education.
 
 I have strong analytical skills and an academic background in scientific research, including scientific writing and communication, with a Bachelor’s degree from Princeton University's Department of Geosciences. I am motivated by collaborative learning and discovery, geologically inspired existentialism, and the irrepressible desire to challenge myself in new ways --- and inspired by public service and social and environmental justice.  

 My research interests are in developing and executing interdisciplinary research projects combining field work with computational modeling and analysis to understand the connections between ecosystems, climate, and the ocean and cryosphere. I am especially interested in studying the effects of climate change on coastal and tundra ecosystems.

\noindent \textsc{Undergraduate summary}:

Sought out challenging interdisciplinary coursework, including courses in geology, theoretical ecology, computer science, ocean physics, computational geophysics, and scientific writing. Submitted three independent research papers to the \geo, including a senior thesis, on the mass wasting of the Greenland ice sheet, working on data reduction methods for global spherical harmonics and comparing the gravimetric signal of mass loss to environmental forcings from climate model reanalysis.

Extensive experience working with MatLab, Java, ArcGIS, \LaTeX. Additional experience working with R, python, github. Some exposure to C, Fortran.\\
